## Technologies used
The technologies utilized for this project include 
1. MongoDB- We have used mongoDB as the database for this project because of it's following features
    - Flexible data modelling
    - Powerful query language
    - Vertical & horizontal Scalability
2. ExpressJS- We have used expressJS to create REST API's. Express.js simplifies building APIs by providing a minimalistic and intuitive framework with a straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax. Here are a few ways in which Express.js simplifies API development 
    - Routing
    - Middleware
    - Request and Response Handling
3. React- We used React for my project because it offers several advantages for building user interfaces. Here are the reasons why we chose React and why it stands out compared to other frameworks:
    - Component-Based Approach
    - Unidirectional Data Flow
    - Building Cross-Platform Mobile Apps
    - Virtual DOM
4. NodeJS- NodeJS is used to run JS on server side. It uses an event-driven architecture, which means it can efficiently handle multiple tasks and respond to events in a non-blocking way. Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries that significantly enhance its functionality and provide developers with ready-to-use solutions for various tasks.
